This project was developed using NetBeans and is designed to handle basic user login/logout operations while tracking user sessions, activities, and historical logs.
User data is logged using a MySQL database, specifically within a schema named users.
To ensure proper functionality, please make sure that a schema named users exists in your MySQL database, and that it contains a table with the following VARCHAR fields: userName, password, and email.
